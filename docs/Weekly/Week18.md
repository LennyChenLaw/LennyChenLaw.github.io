+ [I’m 29. If You’re in your 20’s, Watch THIS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT1PC2Zmq2o)
>number one view your life as a book and you as the author // you need to be a little 'delulu' // forgive your parents // enjoy being lost in life // you have to build your own dreams or someone will hire you to build theirs // no one know what they're doing // always apply the 7 by 7 rule: won't matter in 7 years, don't spend +7 minutes // spending more time with your loved ones is never a waste of time // more information is not the answer to your problems // invest in your body or it will steal your time and money // 'i wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them' - Andy Bernard // appreciate the time you're living now // everything in life is a trade-off // people will come and go throughout your life // completion doesn't exist. happiness is a practice not a destination. // scarcity is one of the worst types of programming that we grew up with // you don't need most of the material things you want // stop waiting to 'feel like it' // do 1% less of bad things and 1% more of good things // when you want something: ask for it and when you don't hear back: follow up // mental energy is one of your most valuable resources // you will work hard early in life or late in life but you will have to work hard either way // if it's something you can figure out, don't complain // your life can change in 2 seconds // always trust the coin // start adding the word 'yet' to the end of certain sentences // not taking enough risks turns into regrets. don't afraid to take more calculated risk when you're younger. you'll have more than enough time to rebound if it doesn't work out // how you start your morning sets a tone for the rest of your day // the only person you shorld feel obligated to say yes to: is yourself // use money to buy time and freedom. money gives you the freedom to choose what to do with your life. //

you will never be a master but being a student is so much better // 

+ [Are You Willing to Pay the Price of Greatness?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7TcCr3uRkg)
>obssesion // this pursuit isn't 
about happiness or contentment. it's about purpose. it's about the belief that without this dream life would lose all meaning but there's a price for chasing a dream sacrifices must be made. // 'he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how' - Friedrich Nietzsche // Yung saw dreams not just as external goals but as part of the inner journey toward becoming whole. A process he called individuation. // Yung also warned of the dangers of unchecked ambition he believed that if a person's dream became too consuming it could lead to ego inflation, a state where the person becomes disconnected from their true self. //
