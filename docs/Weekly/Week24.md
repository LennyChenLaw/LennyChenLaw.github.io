+ [Being a Call Center Employee in the Philippines Be Like.. | TRABAHO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfS-E4on0ao)
>Hello, thank you for calling. Customer service, my name is Jessica. How can I help you today? // wrong item problem // Oh, we're so sorry for the wrong item that was delivered to you. Please let me put you on hold and get back to you right away. // trabaho - a work; an employment; a job; a chore. Borrowed from Spanish trabajo. At the same time, there is a website called [trabaho](https://trabaho.com/). It seems to be {++The Premier Philippine Jobs Site++}. {>>It's like a Philippine version LinkedIn?<<} // Call center employee // BPO stands for {++Business Process Outsourcing++}. When an applicant comes in what they understand about the BPO is that, you know, {++take calls everyday++}, {answer cunstomer inquiry}, {++back office support++}. // Impromptu interview: - My name is Jean. I'll be facilitating your initial interview. What do you expect about the BPO industry? - I expect bridging accounts and different clients as a customer service agent through speaking on the phone. Good community life, I guess, in VXI. Learning from my co-workers. And just improving myself because it's my first job. // BPO training - we are {++the bridge++} // Start with a greeting. - Why do you think our customers need {++Empathy, Action, Reassurance++}. - So they feel supported? And they feel like we listen to them. - Okay. It's our responsibility to make them feel good about our service, about our company. Now, we do have here some examples. {++The customer said that he received the wrong item. The customer is so pissed off!++}. // She is doing the {++empathizing++} and she is also doing the {++reassurance.++} // So she is reassuring the customer that it's okay. I am here to help you out. Don't worry about it. // - What's the best part of being a call center agent? - Talagang stressful! But what helps is yung we do have events like, for example, Mother's Day...Free massage for the mothers. The perks! Of having those engagement events NA FREEBIE! for employees. On our HMO benefit, we do have a specific allotment for our mental health. Actually here in VXI, we do have a specific program wherein we train those people who doesn't have any work experience. So we can develop their communication skills. We can teach them {++'call center English'++}. So they can adapt at the job very easily. // - Why do you think there are a lot of call center agents here? - The workforce here in the Philippines is actually cheaper than in other countries. Twoi would be the language. Since Filipinos already have English subjects since Grade 1, I think. Most of them are already equipped with the knowledge. It just need some improvement in terms of communication skills 'pag nag-call center na sila'. We have a lot of employees who doesn't have call center backgrounds pero they get hired. Some have been promoted? Filipinos are very diligent. They're hardworking. They're always motivated to provide for their families. Not only that, they can adopt to a specific culture pretty easily. // - What are they like? How can they be mean? - They won't let you talk! Once you pick up the call...But don't worry about it! Just like what I mentioned earlier, if it's too much and they're being abusive with their language... - Oh yeah What can you do? They crossed the line, for example. They're like 'Your mother is like...' - You can tell them that 'Sorry, but as much as I wanna help you, we can't proceed if you're going to be like that to me. You can do that. It's your right as a human being! ' // The accent. Still be patient. You know, they're just trying to annoy you because they're annoyed themselves, so just try to speak a little bit slower. // "Prod area" 通常是 Production Area 的缩写，具体意思会根据上下文不同而有所变化 // We're so sorry for the inconvenience. I can see where you're coming from that you couldn't take the call three times. Since you got me here, let me assist you today with your concerns. May I know what is your problem? // - I forgot my password. May I have your account number and name please? // - I just recently got promoted, and I definitely want to take advantage of the money that I got. I would love to purchase a new phone. And if you have some cheap/affordable package for me...Can you recommend one? - First of all, congratulations on your new gig. I would like to offer you some of the packages we have. As of now, we have a promo. If you buy an Iphone 14 which is the newest product in line, you can actually get an Apple Watch at 50% off, only if you can purchase it before May 18. purchase it before May 18. How does that sound? - I think that's a good package. How am I going to proceed with the payment? - So I have sent you the details of the package to your email package to your email that I was able to sign through your account number and you can look through the package one more time to confirm with your purchase. // All right, Is there anything else that I can help you with today? All right thank you so much. Once again, this was Jessica Lee if you could please stay on the line to take a brief three question survey. Have a great day. // An outbound call is one initiated by a call center agent to a customer on behalf of a call center or client. Right now, we will be conducting what we call the {++pre-screening interview.++} the aim of this interview is to assess or to check the basic qualifications of our candidates or applicants before we even endorse them for the initial interview. So basically the sample questions that we have here are just you know to assess their profile. And of course, their {++personal background, educational background, occupational background and so on.++} // May I confirm if this is Nicanor? // First of all, Is this your first time to apply VXI? // Do you have any BPO or call center experience in the past? // "Graveyard shift" 指的是夜班工作，通常指的是凌晨到早上之间的时段。 // May I know how much is your expected salary? // Thank you so much for taking my call, Nicanor. Have a great day and stay safe. As always. //

>{++1. Show, don't tell.++} // It could definitely be made more persuasive and you can be more persuasive if you {++paint pictures using words++}. For example, you should hire me because I'm hardworking. As a teacher for five years, my job demanded that I perform different tasks for different occasions. I organized school activities, ensured that my students learned my lectures, acted as their second parent and performed repetitive tasks like writing lesson plans. It wasn't always easy; at times, it was overwhelming other times it's monotonous but my willingness to work hard was what kept me going for five straight years and I believe that this will truly help me thrive as a CSR. // Answer #1 The answer all it says is 'I'm great, I'm great, I'm great.' Answer #2 Not only says I'm great but also explains why it did this by painting a picture with words. // PTA 指的是 Parent-Teacher Association，即家长教师协会。 // {++2. Avoid generic, cliché, vague answers.++} Zoom in and be more specific. // replace 'hardworking' with 'a strong sense of responsibility' // great at customer service: patient, conscientious, resilient to stress, willing to go above and beyond, not easily affected by negative emotions, a knack for easily understanding nonverbals, a knack for making complex ideas easy to undrstand, knows the balance between being friendly and being firm. // 3. Inject life into your delivery verbally and nonverbally. // Bad performance in the interview: Sounds unsure, very little vocal variety, monotonous, too many sentences that end with an upward inflection, closed body language(hunched shoulders, slouching), self-soothing gestures(Gestures that reveal anxiety, don't contribute to the message, and distracts.) // Good performance in the interview: Eye contact(Makes eye contact during important points of the message.), Open body language(straight back, open shoulders), vocal variety in pitch, speed, and intonation. Pauses when gathering thoughts with very minimal fillers // Hand gestures(Hand gestures have purpose and add to the message, not distract from it.) // Mimic the people that you want to emulate.

>{++Bad customer service:++} - Thank you for calling Kwestyon. This is Claire, How may I help you today? - I still have not my order you said i would receive it on the 20th, it's on the 22nd, still nothing. i don't know what's going on but if it's not too much of a bother to you i would really really now love to get what i paid for you know what i mean. 没有先表示同理心和礼貌用语 - okay you may have the order number and your first name? - I mean, it's ridiculous if there's a delay you could just tell me it's not like you don't have my email or anything. You didn't notify me at all if i forgot that i'd ordered it which by the way happens sometimes, then i'd completely be paying for nothing. 态度很糟糕，客户诉说了自己的问题，没有表示同理心，没有礼貌词，直接让人家等着 - One moment, please while I check your order status. - Okay, okay. First of all, my apartment has no front porch. Second, the only way to deliver parcels in a residence is by leaving them to the concierge. That's it! Third, I was at home the whole day on the 20th and no one, literally no one knocked on my door or called my number to notify me of a parcel so whatever this Fedex guy is saying, he's lying, okay? He's lying! 到这里，如果客户所讲情况属实，那么可以看出过错方不是客户，客户急需心情安抚和一个解决方案 - Have you tried tracking with the buildings concierge to see if they have kept a package for you or...不该这么问，显得完全没听客户讲话，客户先前已经提到了concierge和20th自己一直在家，那足以判断客户大概率已经问过了concierge，这件事大概率是Fedex那边出了问题，即便真的要问，也可以问封闭式的，好回答的问题，比如 'You already checked with concierge and found no parcel right?'别把苦活累活交给客户，要让客户感到轻松，只要回答Yes or No最好 - I just checked this morning and the answer is no! There's no parcel! Otherwise, I wouldn't be calling you! 可以看出现在客户情绪已经非常激动了 - How about your neighbors have you checked with them to see if they received your parcel？完全没听客户讲话，客户先前已经提到快递签收要么给concierge，要么是本人签收，20th客户全程在家，没送给她本人而是让neighbors签收可能性不大，而且即便真的被neighbors签收了，这也显然是Fedex的锅，包裹主人在家你没联系还送错了地址，应该对客户表示抱歉和同理心。即便真要问也应该是 'And you checked with your neighbors, they didn't mistakenly sign for your package, right?' - Tabitha I'm just doing my job. This is a standard protocol. We have to make sure that the receiver has checked all the possible places the parcel could have been delivered. 确实有protocol，但我们得用一种正确的方式来follow protocol，与客户打交道要灵活变通，本着服务精神，让人舒适的基础上follow protocol。'Tabitha I'm just doing my job.'这句话其实没必要，客户没有义务同情我们，客户遇到了问题，并且目前证据显示过错方不在她，于是她想让问题得到解决，我们需要辅助解决客户的问题，事情就这么简单，客户是受害方，并没有义务还来体谅我们的工作，反而应该是我们同情客户的遭遇，并且表现的非常helpful，才能缓和客户情绪，得到认可。 - I know！ But do your job right！ You're not even trying! I've been spending my time here listening to you and the only thing you're doing so far is asking me dumb questions! Like, what kind of service is this? I just want to get what I paid for! Is that so wrong to ask?客户现在已经很生气了，而且客户也点明了自己的诉求{++'I just want to get what I paid for! Is that so wrong to ask?'++}，这是非常合理的诉求，客户已经强调了自己的受害人情况，客服这个时候应该理解客户，通过言语缓和客户情绪（但不要直接说让客户calm down，是通过各种礼貌词，过硬的解决问题的业务能力让客户慢慢平静下来，而不是来一句‘您好，请您冷静一点好吗？’），并帮助客户解决问题。 - Please calm down(踩雷了), Tabitha. I'm here to help you. - It's not that simple Tabitha. You have to confirm in writing because that's what we're going to show Fedex so they can begin the investigation. So you know, this is necessary to prove that we are not making this all up. Once the claim is filed, we will investigate and uh depending on the investigation, it will take seven around seven business days and then we can refund or replace or find your missing parcel. 念稿一样，而且七个工作日，实际上也没给出个实际解决方案，客户还是没有安全感，反而会感觉你在拖延问题。 - I wouldn't recommend that as {--that might poorly reflect on your credit score--} especially that it shows delivered, you know. So the best option i recommend is to let us file a claim on your behalf. That's what I recommend. 这跟恐吓一样的语气是什么鬼？态度不好，而且还是没说清楚解决方案, file a claim，什么claim？有什么效果？几天后能拿到我的包裹，还是能退款？客户之后还需要做什么？这些都没表达出来 - Okay so uh how would you like to proceed？别把这种开放式问题跑给客户 // {++Great customer service:++} - 体会到对方焦急的心情，尽快给出回复 I will now go ahead and pull up your order and hopefully I can give you an immediate answer. One moment, please. - 肯定对方，表示理解 Okay, like what you said, the estimated delivery date is on the 20th. It's now the 22nd so it's two days late. Normally when a person is late like this we send an email informing you of the delay so let me visit the fedex website and track it. // Yes, that makes sense. So here's what we're going to do, Tabitha. It is likely that Fedex delivered the order to the wrong address so I will file a PDNR claim on your behalf. It means parcel delivered not received. What this does is to let fedex investigate to find your missing parcel. 给出解决方案，让客户有个心理预期和安全感 And after the investigation we will either refund replace or find your missing parcel. // Please reply to that email confirming that you have not received your parcel. Your response to that email is very important because that will serve as the documentation proving to Fedex that you are requesting for us to file a claim on your behalf. 考虑周到，从客户的角度出发 By the way, in the event that the parcel isn't recovered would you prefer a replacement or a refund.

> when I saw that you're hiring for customer service {++reps++}("Reps" 在这句话中是 "代表" 的意思，指的是 "客户服务代表"。) // - You siad that you loved your previous job but why did you quit? - First, I want to upgrade my skills. I have been handling customer service locally. It was a great experience, It was helpful but I think It's time for me to explore on an international level. Second for someone in my situation, I think I would have a better shot financially and career-wise if i joined this industry. - Okay, in what way would working in this industry be beneficial to you career-wise? - Sharpen my communication skills. That is a huge plus to anyone because wherever you go whether you're in a high or entry-level position, a great communication skill is something that will always be useful to you. And I think it's a prerequisite to anyone who wants to have a career and I want to have a career and I think I can achieve that by joining this industry. // - Some people say that working in a BPO industry in a call center industry is a {++dead-end++}("Dead-end" 在这句话中表示“没有发展前景”或“缺乏晋升机会”的意思。) job, do you agree? - No, absolutely not. This job has disadvantages just like any other but I don't think this is a dead-end job. I know some agents who were promoted to a higher position and they started off as agents. I also know some who are no longer working in this industry and are now working for higher paying jobs in a related industry like online freelancing for example and a lot of them told me that they don't think that that they would have gotten to where they are now had they not worked in this industry. So that doesn't sound like a dead-end job to me because there is progress. // - May I ask why didn't you pursue computer programming? I see here that you finished it successfully. Why did you work in a milk tea store after graduation? - It's a long story but um I only finished a two-year course, a vocational course, technically. {++And I'm not saying that it's impossible to find a job with this level of education but it is definitely a struggle.++}(这句话很好用的样子，既没有贬损自己，也让HR理解自己没有继续做computer programming的原因) I experienced it firsthand when I was competing with {++degree holders++} and at that time my funds were already running out and I was only left with two choices either to go back to the province and be jobless or to find a job immediately and I chose the latter because I wanted to stay in the city and explore other opportunities and so it just so happened that a milk tea store was hiring and I managed to get in and ended up liking it. // - Do you have plans to pursue computer programming in the future? - Not really, I love programming and I think I was decent at it but i don't think I'm going to pursue it any longer my interest now lies in the BPO industry. // - Where do you see yourself five years from now? - {++It's hard to tell. And I don't want to sound too ambitious but I would love to be in a higher position where I can specialize in one area and then I can use that skill to impact the company positively but as to what that expertise is i am not sure i cannot really tell for now but i definitely see myself in the BPO industry five years from now.++}(很厉害的回答，可以背一下) // - Within those two years of working as a cashier and service crew what was the hardest experience you had with a customer and how did you deal with it? - okay uh so there's this one customer who insisted that she already paid even if she didn't. Um I remember when I asked for the payment she just replied 'what are you talking about, I already gave you a 1000 peso bill. Where's my change? ' There is a cctv in front of us. So I told her ma'am I don't want any trouble I am not accusing you of anything. How about we have that cctv checked so we can confirm whether or not uh a bill was handed to me and all of a sudden she just gave me the exact amount and she walked out without a word. // - Do you think you can handle irate western customers? - yes i have dealt with customers face to face and i believe i can also handle them over the phone i am not downplaying the difficulty that comes with talking to people who don't share your language and your culture but i believe that my experience in customer service is a solid foundation for that. // - how do you usually de-stress? // - What is your greatest weakness? // Was there ever a time when making small talk yielded a positive result for you? // - What do you know about the tasks of a call center agent? - Based on my research because I have done a lot of research on this. Call center agents talk to customers about products and services. It could be inbound where the customers are calling the call center the agents to ask for help about something for example the other day I called {++Globe++}("Globe" 这里指的是一家电信公司，类似于中国移动、联通、电信等。) about a missing prepaid load and an agent helped me recover it.(视角转变，自己作为客户的时候了解到的call center agent，很真实，很有生活体验感，感觉这个回答相当好) I think that was inbound and there's another setup which is outbound where the ones doing the calling are the agents and they're calling the customers to either sell something or to conduct a survey. So that's outbound. And lastly I know that being a call center agent is not an easy job. That's all I know. // - This is an unusual question but why do you think manholes are round? - I think that to answer that question you would have to ask what would happen if manholes are built as squares or rectangles as opposed to round and I think the answer to that is if they're built as squares then the cover would fall off easily into the hole if it's it's placed in a wrong position whereas if you build a manhole cover with a round shape then i don't think that problem happens if it's a perfect round so i guess they're building it round for convenience that's my opinion. // - How would you describe color red to a blind person since birth? - okay um i think i would describe it in a way that a blind person could relate to. Um he couldn't see he doesn't have a sense of sight but he could feel my description by me using the other functioning senses like the sense of taste uh touch, smell. You know, just an as an anchor to help him understand a color. - Okay pretend that I am that blind person describe red to me right now. - Okay, so think of red as something warm and nourishing. It's the warmth you feel when you're sipping a hot {++Tinola++}("Tinola" 是菲律宾的一种传统汤，用鸡肉、蔬菜和姜黄制作。) on a rainy day. It could also be the warm kiss of someone you love or the warm hug by a lover. It's passionate, it's warm, it's red.(这个通感的思路挺有意思的) // - Why should we hire you? - Aside from my job experience and my intention to stay in this industry long term. I do not shy away from irate customers. I never shy away from them even if it's uncomfortable. I have experienced hand handling them i know how to handle them and i have the mental strength to do it. // - Do you have any questions for me? - You said a while ago that you have plenty of friends in this industry and they're thriving. what do you think do they have in common in terms of that one factor that contributed to them being successful in this industry because i seriously would love to know.
