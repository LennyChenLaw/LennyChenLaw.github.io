+ [The 5 core principles of life | Nobel Prize-winner Paul Nurse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EwVBC3VsRA)
>What is Life? // Yeast has similar reproduction gene with human's->Every plant, every animal, and every fungus-was controlled by the same mechanism. // Purpose to be better adapted in the life state it finds itself, and so we can evolve living things from one type into another. And for me, that bounds everything together that emphasizes the core principles underlying life.

+ [What staying up all night does to your brain - Anna Rothschild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idrbwnWLJ7w)
>When you stay up all night, you're fighting against your body's natural circadian rhythms. // As the sun sets, your eyes send signals about the dwindling light to a part of your brain called suprachiasmatic nucleus. This is basically your circadian rhythm’s clock. It alerts your pineal gland to start producing melatonin. That’s the hormone that helps prepare your body for sleep, and levels start to rise about two hours before your normal bedtime. At the same time, neurons in the hypothalamus and brain stem release a compound called GABA. This slows down activity in your brain and can have a calming effect. // Throughout the day, your brain has been releasing a waste product called adenosine. The more adenosine latching onto receptors in your brain, the more tired and inattentive you become. // Caffeine blocks adenosine from binding to receptors, which can give you a boost of energy. However, it might also make you jittery and increase your anxiety. // Sleep deprivation can briefly induce euphoria. It's caused a temporary boost in dopamine levels, which can unfortunately also lead to poor choices.

>maleta // dentro // Hay cosas, y vosotros tenéis que {++adivinar++} qué son esas cosas, así que empecemos. // pequeña // redonda // Es un amarillo raro, no es amarillo como esto: No es este tipo de amarillo, es un amarillo distinto, esto es amarillo, amarillo.

+ [IELTS Speaking Band 7.0 Mock Test with Feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJhplp3dct8)
>Are you working or studying right now? // What is an off-book period? // Do you enjoy your studies? // what do you enjoy doing in your free time? // What is your hometown? // what are some things that you like about one of your hometowns?(考生算有两个hometown，一个是Schindellegi，另一个是군포市，所以这里这么问) // What are some things you don't like about it? // Do you like shopping? // Do you compare prices when you shop? // Is it difficult for you to make choices when you shop? // Do you think expensive products are always better than cheaper products? // Can you describe a time when you changed your opinion? // Do children like to change their opinions? // When do people change opinions? // Who do young people turn to for advice? // Do people like to give opinions about politics? // fluency and pronounciation不错, {++natural rhythm of speaking++}, grammar and vocabulary also good, but when describing landscape instead of saying 'it's {--wide--}' it'd be better to say 'it's {++expansive++}'. // good advanced word 'inquisitive' // something like politics can be controversial because it has sort of emotional  charge. Ice cream flavors they might be hotly debated but it's a sort of in a playful spirit so I'm not sure it would be described as controversial. // And it would probably would be possible in that answer to think of some other ways to express the idea you wanted to try it. // trying for more variety to express the idea // keep {--off--} away from negative thoughts


+ [How This Pen Changed The World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb1PrONDHhk)
>Since it's release in 1950, more than 100 billion of these pens have been sold worldwide, blowing the next bestselling products out of the water. // {++Laszlo Biro++} - He realized that the solution was in the ink. // Most pins at the time used thin, water-based ink which was leaky, slow drying and would seep through the fibers of the paper. It also relied on gravity to feed the ink into the ball which, depending on the angle of the pen, gave really poor results. He started experimenting with oil-based inks which were thicker, dried almost instantly and sat on top of the paper instead of seeping through. This turned out to be a stroke of genius and it unlocked a unique physical effect that caused the ink to be mysteriously pulled onto the ball without gravity or any external forces. This is called {++capillary action++} and it's what allows water to climb tree roots and nutrients to flow around our body. // A few years later French manufacturer {++Marcel Bich++} discovered Biro's pen and saw a huge opportunity. He bought the patents for $2 million and began designing a new and improved version that could be mass-produced for a much cheaper price. With the help of state-of-the-art Swiss watchmaking machines he developed a method for mass-producing tiny stainless steel balls to within a fraction of a millimeter. // The pen had a hexagonal barrel like a pencil which stopped it from rolling off tables and made it easier to grip. // It was made from polystyrene which was strong, cheap and transparent, allowing the ink level to be seen at all times. // There was a tiny hole on the barrel which allowed air to enter and replace ink as it left the pen. // The ink inside the cartridge was a special recipe that maximized the capillary effect while still producing a good quality line. The ink flowed into the tip of the pen which contained the stainless steel ball. The ball was machined so accurately and could move just enough to spin and deposit ink onto the page. // The lid which also doubled as a the clip was made from polypropylene which absorbed impacts and stopped the pen from cracking. //
