+ [500 days of chasing my dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL_-TmEIgsw)
>lesson 1: there are not enough opportunities for everyone's dreams // I made it a goal to make the most out of my newfound passion by following one simple rule: let your curiosity lead you places. I wanted to share my creativity with friends so we documented life and went on spontaneous photo shoots all throughout campus. I wanted to be involved with my sport again so I asked the basketball team to work for free. I wanted to start freelancing so I networked around campus to work with businesses and organizations. And over time my once mundane college life started feeling full of joy and excitement I bonded with friends met new people lived new experiences ran my own business and reconnected with the game I love but more importantly it was the first time in life I felt a strong sense of purpose. // I've always wanted to live in a big city. Growing up, I was spoiled by the nature of the Pacific Northwest but whenever I visited Chicago or New York City I was always enamored by the energy radiated by the busting streets and concrete abyss. Something about the possibilities felt endless here. It was the perfect place to figure out the question I've been trying to answer my whole life: who even am I among this madness. // the way we view our past failures dictates a lot of the future decisions we make. // The more I lived the more I realized not only does everyone lose at some point but most people don't care about your failures as much as you do and that's when I realized the ones that truly fail are the ones that never allow themselves to // everything on life was made up by people no smarter than you. you can change it, influence it, and build your own things that other people can use // your anxiety & fears are your superpowers // make the most out of your opportunities // the more you know who you are and what you want, the less you'll let things upset you // 生き甲斐: The word you're referring to is likely **"ikigai" (生き甲斐)**. It's a Japanese concept that roughly translates to *"reason for being"*. 
Ikigai is a philosophy about finding meaning and purpose in life. It often involves discovering a balance among four interconnected aspects: 1. **What you love** (your passion), 2. **What you are good at** (your vocation), 3. **What the world needs** (your mission), 4. **What you can be paid for** (your profession). The intersection of these four areas is your *ikigai*, or the sweet spot that gives your life meaning and satisfaction. It's a popular idea globally, often associated with living a fulfilling and happy life. // we can go fast on our own, but one can go much further with the right people.


+ [You Need to Romanticize Your Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q41i0wpX4qc)
>what would your life look like if you loved the process of working on your craft, your project, your art. if it was something that you looked forward to, not something that you avoided, not something that you procrastinated on, but something that you were eager to get to every day. // romanticizing the process is necessary // Grow the Inner Artist // During those pockets of time just let the silence be there. Maybe you don't want to work on your craft because you don't have fun ideas to act on. Well, here you go, here's an opportunity to actually get ideas, it's right there in front of you, the silence, the allowance for these ideas to come in.


+ [6 books that changed how I see the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uctUh0Z2YTc)
>We should prioritie truth, we should prioritize wisdom // And leisure for Aristotle is sort of the absence of necessary work that then allows you to do the things that really matter 


+ [Singapore Got Crazy Rich. But at what Cost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUL_H_ISouM)
>But as Singapore has continued to expand, a hidden set of problems has been growing out of sight // 1.in the last few years, prices for almost all aspects of daily life have skyrocketed 2.urban poverty has been gaining speed // sandwich class(在这句话中，“sandwich class” 指的是夹在中间的阶层，指的是收入在中等偏上的群体。他们收入过高无法获得政府的低收入援助，但同时又过低无法享受高收入者的特权和资源。) // KIASU: Fear of losing
