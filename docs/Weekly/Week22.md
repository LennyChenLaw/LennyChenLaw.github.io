## 视频
+ [How sugar affects the brain - Nicole Avena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEXBxijQREo)
>What happens in the brain that makes sugary foods so hard to resist? Sugar is a general term used to describe a class of molecules called carbohydrates, and it's found in a wide variety of food and drink. // Glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, dextrose, and starch are all forms of sugar. // The sugars it contains activate the sweet-taste receptors, part of the taste buds on the tongue. // From here, the signal activates the brain's reward system. This reward system is a series of electrical and chemical pathways across several different regions of the brain. // Overconsumption of sugar can have addictive effects on the brain

+ [For those waiting for life to happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij84DoCEmdI)
>We watch movies and hope that life is as fluid and calculated as it is on screen, either this or that, with a clear outcome of each decision they make. It's like looking into a mirror and seeing how you'd want everything to be. We all want an example, a one-size-fits-all handbook to help us navigate through. But we can't just wait around for life to happen to us...We have to seek it. // You have to do things. You have to take risks. It's the only way to find out who we really are, and what we wanna do with our time on this earth. And even if we fail, what better way is there to live?生活中充满了不确定性和各种各样的难题，它不像教科书一样充满范式和解题步骤，我们每个人都要以自己的方式，去寻找自己的答案，Nobody is better at being you than you. 这个过程可能是很煎熬的，所以我们要充满勇气的生活，所谓人类的赞歌就是勇气的赞歌，我想这也是其中一层意义，面对生活的勇气，面对未知的勇气，面对自己的勇气。

+ [15 Skills That Pay Off Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGA6iBKAT8w)
> Learning how to learn(上期周刊也提到了meta learning) // The ability to adapt, improvise, and overcome obstacles. // Clearing your mind. You are not your body. You are not the things you own. You are not what people think of you. You are your mind. // The ability to verbalize what you think and feel // The ability to sell and negotiate // Knowing how to shut up, listen and learn from the person you're talking to // The ability to self motivate // Building and maintaining discipline // Energy management // The ability to read and understand // The ability to break a process down into smaller steps // Self analysis // Emotional intelligence and empathy // Self-respect and having a backbone // The ability to generate ideas that have value.


+ [6 Levels of Thinking Every Student MUST Master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xqerXscTsE)
>Level 1 is all about memorizing things this involves a lot of rereading, rewriting->regurgitate // Level 2 Understand->Explain // Level 3 Apply->simple problem-solving // Level 4 Analyze(Comparing & contrasting)->comparison. ChatGPT Prompt: 'Give me questions at 2nd year university level for microbiology at Bloom's revised taxonomy level 4'. Thesis - [Perceiving effort as poor learning: The misinterpreted-effort hypothesis of how experienced effort and perceived learning relate to study strategy choice](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010028519302270). // Level 5 Evaluate->prioritize // Level 6 Create(Creating a hypothesis)->Hypothesis


+ [Secret To Getting Better At Talking To People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvgM39UgHbA)
>human brain is actually extremely good and identifying patterns and rules when it comes to social interactions which is basically what language is if you think about it. Patterns and rules. So it's not that you were born socially handicapped. The reason your social skills aren't that great is simply because you haven't given your brain enough time to observe interactions and become fluent in all of the patterns and rules. In short, you lack practice. // Messaging on the phone and talking in real life are completely different. // The secret to getting better at talking to people or learning any language is to simply get more practice to interact with more people to give your brain more opportunities to observe and learn the unique patterns and rules of this language. // Here's a good analogy that I want to leave you with when it comes to getting better at talking to people watching videos to learn social skills is sort of like watching videos when you're trying to learn how to ride a bike. Yes it can be very helpful to watch others do it. it can be helpful to learn exactly how bikes even work but {++the fastest way to learn how to ride a bike is to just jump on and start pedaling.++}
