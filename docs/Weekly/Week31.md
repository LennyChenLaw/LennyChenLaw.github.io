+ [British Trains: Did Privatisation Cause the Current Chaos?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIW_uRe4FE4)
>TLDR Business 是一种将冗长的商业信息或内容简化成易于理解、快速浏览的摘要方式。TLDR 代表 “Too Long; Didn't Read”，本来是网络流行语，用来总结长篇内容的关键点。TLDR Business 的核心目标是帮助企业和个人节省时间，专注于重要的信息 // it's no secret that traveling in the UK by train is not exactly an enjoyable experience at the moment. Strike days are making it difficult to tell if the trains were even running. And even when they are, they're often delayed, or overcrowded. For the always like this, do they have to be like this and why are they like this. // It's worth starting this video by establishing what makes the UK's position with trains so unique. Here in the UK, the railways are privatized and have been since the late 90s. 

+ [South Korea's NEWEST High Speed Train - The 320km/h KTX Cheong-Ryong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrV6wap3Dck)
>One thing I have to give credit to Seoul station for is its simple interior design; it's very easy to navigate! On both upper levels you'll find plenty of shops and other amenities, with some being local and others more familiar to Westerners... You'll also find lockers if you fancy exploring the city and want to securely store luggage whilst doing so, as well as ticket offices and machines for state operator Korail, who operate all mainline services here, making Seoul station well equipped for handling the over 100,000 passengers who use this station daily, but not just for mainline traffic; many passengers here will also be using the extensive Seoul Metro and AREX services to Incheon airport! // the original KTX was built by Alstom and later Rotem through a technology transfer arrangement in the late 90s and early 2000s based on the French TGV Reseau, and marked the beginning of high speed rail in South Korea. In the 2010s, Hyundai Rotem then introduced the domestically-made KTX Sancheon, which used the transferred French TGV technology as a basis.

+ [We Took Korea’s FIRST CLASS Bullet Train (Seoul to Busan) 🇰🇷](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZBHBxwbBDE)
>if it didn't have these really wide armrests, I could probably fit two of me in here. Speaking of armrests it's got two lovely big armrests, you can recline the seat as well. It's got a footrest. // In this first class sort of uh in between a section there is a vending machine, for first class passengers that gives you free water and I'll take one please // there's also a library so you can read some stuff, if you read Korean there's also some newspapers down here as well 


+ [ALONE Travel to KOREA 🇰🇷 ~ 혼자 한국에 갑니다! ~ Travel vlog ~ 한국 여행 브이로그](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4XxYsTnrWg)
>I charged my {++bus card++} with 2001 which is like 20 euros basically. // The stop where I was at was literally a taxi stop, so they told me to go and take a taxi and I was waiting a bus like... I got Wi-Fi and I looked that to get to my hotel, not Hotel, whatever, {++Airbnb++} it takes 1 hour and 20 minutes 


+ [My 1st Day In Shanghai 🇨🇳 (What's China Really Like?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luXAfmkN1yo)
>-We can drive on the streets with the bikes? - yeah - oh that's {++not allowed in Germany++} - But there's a special Street, a special Road  - There's a special part of the road for the bicycles // But first I want to visit this Temple right here, it's called the jingan temple and it's one of the most famous temples here in Shanghai and what's interesting here the people trying to uh throw coins up there, probably that's for for good luck. // It's 632 meters, and yeah, therefore, it's the third tallest tower in the world. Only the Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai are taller.
