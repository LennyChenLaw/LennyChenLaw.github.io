## 视频
+ [how to learn ANY language by gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dig0V4p69FM)
>VRchat // immersive input: high exposure to the language from what you read or hear. comprehensive input: input where you understand most of it, if not all // play Valorant in Spanish // watch Jujutsu kaisen in Spanish // forcing myself to use my phone in Spanish taught me so many words that are relevant in so many categories of life, especially internet and computer terms i use in English all the time 

+ [21 Lessons I Learned at 21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzK_xhDCSpo)
>have the audacity to be unapologetically yourself // take photos, lots and lots of photos // live as if you are playing in a single-player world // you don't need to know how // a maxed townhall 10 is better than a rushed townhall 13 // only you, can do the best job at being yourself // remember your roots // don't worry about trying to be yourself, just be // every rejection you face is simply a redirection in disguise // be kind to your parents, it's their first time living too // failing is good // confrontation is not a bad thing. In fact if done correctly, it's healthy. // learn to
set your boundaries, or else other people will set the boundaries for you // fantasizing and creating stories in your head is not normal // if you didn't realize what you had until you lost it, you weren't being fully grateful for it // the only person that's gonna be there for you, for your entire life, is you, so learn to love yourself for the person you are // you are born twice: the first one is when you're actually born, and the second is when you realize you only have one life // complacency kills relationships // people come and go, even the people you never think would // tell the people that you love, that you love them before it's too late // friends are like snowflakes if you pee on them, they go away (wtf???－_－)

+ [If you're ambitious but lazy, please watch this video…](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvRF-YScNQc)
>fear: not just fear of judgement it's fear of ourselves // take action // it's about time you shut the fuck up and go and do that 


+ [Stop Trying To Understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzXZ4-KzBLs)
>advice: don't spend too much time working on any one problem because I couldn't afford to waste the time // a lot of times in mathematics when you revisit things that you've seen in the past it's easier // it's okay to not get it but it's not okay to quit. keep doing mathematics. 


+ [The Core Equation Of Neuroscience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOmhHE2xctw)
>Q = CV // $C\frac{dV}{dt}=\sigma I_{ion}$ // cells are very complicated systems, we need to pick state variables, to approximate the system with a model // cell membrane voltage // Equilibrium potential and driving force // Voltage-dependent conductance
