## 视频
+ [CHINA is NOT what we expected - FIRST 24 HOURS in Beijing 🇨🇳](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33bZIOLX4do)
>one of the issues we've had with the Metro is we always have to go to the person because when we use the machines it asks for ID and we don't have Chinese ID obviously. so if you are a foreigner you have to go to the person most of the time. // So we have just arrived at Jing Shang Park which is one of the Viewpoint areas in the city // They've got this music playing in the background and it's so calming.

+ [CHINA’s BIGGEST CITY YOU HAVEN’T HEARD OF - Chongqing 🇨🇳](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek8eN4VxbjA)
>This is just very foreign for us, we are not used to, you know, cooking our own food or cooking be like this like the actual meat. // We are at the Central Plaza. Look at these plants! Flipping heck, these look incredibly flat and symmetrical—almost like CGI, don’t they? Yeah, they look too perfect. // No way! I just saw a policeman on a Segway—or maybe a hoverboard? I’m not sure what to call it. A Segway! Look at this guy—that’s awesome. I wish the police in the UK did that. Look at him go! Even the policemen are living in the future here in Chongqing. If you stop and listen for a moment, you’ll realize there aren’t really any loud sounds. In London, you might hear cars revving, music blasting, or people shouting in bars, but here, everyone is very peaceful and quiet. // So we now are just heading onto the Metro System. Now this system is a little bit different because we've seen that one of them is like a monor rail and we're going to be heading to a very futuristic looking area.

+ [REAL LIFE AVATAR MOUNTAINS - 3 Days in Zhangjiajie, China 🇨🇳](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3O0kwhSS4E)
>So here we are, this is the golden whip stream. Look at the mountains behind us. // I wanted to show you the room we’re staying in because we’re right in the middle of the park. I just can’t recommend booking this enough! If you stay outside the park, you’ll be stuck in all those queues and big crowds, and it’s just not going to be as nice. // whoa these views are actually insane like it does feel we're like we're in the movie Avatar when they're flying like around the rocks that's what I feel like I'm in right now.


+ [Stressful Arrival In Seoul, Korea 🇰🇷](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDPaNL8hab8)
>I’m in the lucky position that, with a German passport, I don’t need a visa. In theory, I can stay visa-free for up to 90 days. But yeah, let’s see what the reality of the immigration process is here. There were, I think, two other foreigners on the flight, so it doesn’t seem like many foreign tourists are arriving in South Korea—at least not many Western tourists. I think they do get a lot of Chinese tourists here, and maybe Japanese tourists as well. // I do have a hotel booking—I’m staying at the Fairfield by Marriott Hotel, which costs me about $100 USD per night. It’s quite near the city center, I believe. We’ll find out what you can get for $100 a night here in South Korea. And yeah, you know, one of the biggest hassles when arriving in a new country is always getting a SIM card. To be honest, I don’t even see a SIM card shop around here, so I’ll probably be spending a lot of time now trying to find one. // The reason I don’t need a SIM card now is that I recently started using eSIMs. An eSIM is basically a digital SIM card that you can install on your phone even before starting your journey.
+ [17 things I wish I knew before visiting CHINA 🇨🇳](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efDOVVDy0iA)
>Bring your passport everywhere // Google Maps doesn't work // Is China safe // Get travel insurance with Safety Wing // Use DIDI // You need mobile data // eSIMS, two eSIM providers: Holafly, airalo // Transport in China // When to go // What is different in China? // Visa's // Subway systems // Try all the food // Translation Apps // VPN's // Register with the police // How to pay in China // Booking tickets in China
