# Crash Course Philosophy

!!! info "课程信息"
    - **课程链接**: :fontawesome-brands-youtube:{ .youtube } [Crash Course Philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNgK6MZucdYldNkMybYIHKR&index=2)
    - **主讲**: [Hank Green](http://hankgreen.com/)
    - **课程简介**: Today Hank begins to teach you about Philosophy by discussing the historical origins of philosophy in ancient Greece, and its three main divisions: metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. He will also introduce logic, and how you’re going to use it to understand and critically evaluate a whole host of different worldviews throughout this course. And also, hopefully, the rest of your life.
    - **部分课程反馈**:<br> 🙌@ennuied: I chose philosophy to find out why I chose philosophy.<br> 🙌@brotataftw6046: This is proof that a "teacher" can determine how u look at a subject<br> 🙌@omi_cha: I hold so much adoration for whoever composed the intro music for this series. it's ethereal
    - **Prerequisite**: If you have some basic:material-information-outline:{ title="Don't ask me how to define basic(_　_)。゜zｚＺ" } understanding of philosophical questions, it would be better, but it's okay if you don't. If you're not accustomed to English lectures, you can download the [Immersive Translate](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/immersive-translate-trans/bpoadfkcbjbfhfodiogcnhhhpibjhbnh?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar) extension at [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/category/extensions?utm_source=ext_sidebar&hl=en-US) and enable the automatic opening of bilingual subtitles. <br> 看过梯利的西方哲学史:material-information-outline:{ title="如果读不下去，苏菲的世界和刘擎的西方现代思想讲义也是不错的选择" }会有一定帮助，不过没有也可以，如果不习惯英文授课，可以在Chrome Web Store下载Immersive Translate插件，打开自动开启双语字幕
