# New Crash Course Biology Series

!!! info "课程信息"
    - **课程链接**: :fontawesome-brands-youtube:{ .youtube } [NEW Crash Course Biology Series!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWGBqskV1UQ&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPW_ofbxdHNciuLoTRLPMgB)
    - **主讲**: [Dr. Sammy](https://www.drsammy.online/)
    - **课程简介**: Welcome to Crash Course Biology! Over the next 50 episodes, Dr. Sammy will show you how you are connected to every bug, bat, and bacteria that has ever lived. From itty-bitty cells to vast global systems, we’ll see how biology can help us understand ourselves better—and our relationships with the living (and non-living) things all around us. Now I know some of you might be thinking: “Didn’t you already do a Biology series?” Yes, we did. But we’re using everything that we’ve learned over the past decade of Crash Course to make you an even better series. Biology 2.0, if you will. Extra-shiny!
    - **部分课程反馈**:<br> 🙌@acaseymonster: I watched the original CC Biology series at least 3 times all the way through as a biology student and now I’m a science teacher and always show crash course to my students! Love that I’ll have an updated series for next year’s bio unit!<br> 🙌@ChimeraZone: I'm actually really exited for this. The energy from Dr. Sammy is just great. I'm gonna breath so many times in preparation for watching the first entry.
    Shoutout to all my other humans that breath.<br> 🙌@Renisanxious: First a Botany course, and now a new Bio course?? Just in time for my second year as an ecology major!!
    - **Prerequisite**: If you have some basic high school biology understanding, it would be better, but it's okay if you don't. If you're not accustomed to English lectures, you can download the [Immersive Translate](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/immersive-translate-trans/bpoadfkcbjbfhfodiogcnhhhpibjhbnh?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar) extension at [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/category/extensions?utm_source=ext_sidebar&hl=en-US) and enable the automatic opening of bilingual subtitles. <br> 最好有一定高中生物基础，没有也可以，如果不习惯英文授课，可以在Chrome Web Store下载Immersive Translate插件，打开自动开启双语字幕
